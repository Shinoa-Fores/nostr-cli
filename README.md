# NOTE
This is a very early proof of concept.

# TODO
- More NIP-01
- NIP-05 resolution
- Sign and send message from bottom input bar
- Load privkeys
- Generate random keypair if no privkey specified
- Allow "read only" type mode for those that want privacy
- Persist to local db? Storage and performance tradeoffs
- Active user list?
- NIP-04 DMs via client?
